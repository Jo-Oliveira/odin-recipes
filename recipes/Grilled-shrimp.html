      The dressing for this dish is made to use with crab, but I think the smoky
      grilled shrimp are a <span id="summer-twist">great summertime twist</span>. 
      <p>Make the dressing ahead of
        time and chill it before you adjust the seasonings.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ cup creme fraiche</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced green onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <div class="steps">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place mayonnaise, ketchup, creme fraiche, 1 tablespoon lemon juice,
          cider vinegar, brown sugar, paprika, salt, cayenne pepper,
          Worcestershire sauce, green onion, and parsley in a bowl. Whisk
          together until ingredients are well combined. Cover and refrigerate
          until thoroughly chilled, 2 to 3 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drizzle olive oil and juice from half a lemon over the shrimp just
          before grilling. Sprinkle with salt and smoked paprika. Gently but
          thoroughly toss until shrimp are coated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grill over hot coals until shrimp are pink and flesh is opaque, about
          2 minutes per side. Transfer to a dish and refrigerate until shrimp
          are chilled, about 30 minutes. You can remove shrimp tails or leave
          them on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide romaine lettuce among serving bowls. Arrange cherry tomatoes,
          avocado slices, and egg halves on top. Season with salt and pepper.
          Ladle on about 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup dressing on the vegetables, and top
          with the shrimp and sliced green onions. Drizzle additional dressing
          over the shrimp, if desired.
        </li>
